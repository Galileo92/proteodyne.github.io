On Mac OSX use the provided launch_chrome_osx.sh to start Proteodyne on Google Chrome.\r\n\r\nNote that if you need to modify the rythmic pattern of the resulting score, the period should match the exact numbers of elements in the pattern.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make changes on the score, use the Advanced tab option, and refer to [VexTab tutorial](http://www.vexflow.com/vextab/tutorial.html). You can also download the MIDI file and use an external software.\r\n\r\n_Generating animated GIF of a big protein can freeze your browser if your computer is not powerful enough._\r\n\r\n### Screenshot\r\n![Proteodyne screenshot](https://github.com/proteodyne/Proteodyne/raw/master/screenshot.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
